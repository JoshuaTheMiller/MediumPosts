# Good Job Probot!

Another Simple Hello World type project, Probot edition.

## Official Getting Started

## Who is this for?

## What is a Probot?

## This will demonstrate

* Getting up and running with a Probot (local development)
* Talk about a few of the files generated with the npx command
  * Get rid of package-lock, start using yarn
  * Discuss planning what you think your app will need so that app.yml can help generate what is necessary. (maybe combine with later sections)
* Configuring hooks, and what to choose
* Configuring permissions
* Interacting with the API on events
* Better Deployment Practices
  * `Good Job Fake/Test/NonProd` registration and `Good Job` registration  
  * Stop using Smee.io, use a real deployment
  * Alternative deployment strategies: serverless
  
  
## Notes 

* Maybe make this a two part article if it is getting too long
